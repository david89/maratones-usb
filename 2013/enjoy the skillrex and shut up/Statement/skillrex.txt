Enjoy the Skillrex and Shut Up!:
================================

Skillrex has noticed somebody has decyphered the complexity of his masterpieces.
That's too mainstream, and being mainstream is not something you could easily live
with.

Skillrex has come with a new plan: a new algorithm for creating his masterpieces.
This is how it goes:

    1. He choose a set of N notes.
    2. He choose a number K of possible repetitions of each note
    3. When he uses a note n_i, next note should be different
    4. He builds a beat by choosing a sequence of K*N notes following the above 
       rules

A valid beat with 4 notes and 2 repetitions would be:

14134232

But this sequence would not:

11234234

Given N and K, can you determine how many possible beats does Skillrex have?

Input:
------

The input will start with a number T, the number of taste cases (1 <= T <= 100).

Each test case will contain a line containing two numbers N (1 <= N <= 10) and
K (1 <= K <= 3).

Output:
-------

For each test case output a line with the number of possible beats Skillrex could
masterfully create modulo 1000007.

Example Input:
--------------

7
3 2
2 2
5 3
10 3
5 2
6 2
2 1

Example Output:
---------------

30
2
606187
854583
39480
631586
