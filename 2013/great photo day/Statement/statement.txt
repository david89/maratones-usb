Great Photo Day
===============

It's the most expected day at your former High School! The great
photo day!.

In this memorable day a group picture of all the students belonging
to the same class is taken and published in the school's yearbook.
For this end the kids from each class are organized in a single row
sorted in ascending order by height, so afterwards the
photographer can take care of immortalizing the moment.

In ancient times there where very few classes in the school, so a picture
was taken for each class and all of them where published in the
yearbook. However, since the amount of classes has exponentially grown due
to city overpopulation, the school's director has decided
to reduce the amount of pictures to be taken by overlaying rows:
two rows of students can be overlaid if when sorted and placed together
none of the students in the front row completely blocks any of the students
in the rear row. Mathematically, if the heights of the students in row a and b, when
sorted in ascending order, are {a_1, a_2, ..., a_m} and {b_1,b_2,...,b_m}, then
row a can be overlaid by row b if a_k > b_k for all k from 1 to m.

Since someone told your former School's director that you are a very clever
computer scientist that aims to attend the ACM-ICPC world finals,
he decided to hire you for building a program that given the specifications
of all students in all the School's classes, computes the minimum amount
of pictures that can be taken for including all classes while allowing
overlaying.

Input:
------

The input will consist of several test cases. The first line of
each test case will consist of two numbers, n, and m (2 <= n,m <= 100);
the number of classes in the school and the number of students per class.
Each of the following n lines will contain m numbers separated by spaces, each
describing the height  h of one of the students in the class (0 <= h <= 1000).
The final test case will have n = m = 0 and should not be processed.

Output:
-------

For each test case print a single line: the minimum amount of pictures
that can be taken for including all classes while allowing overlaying.
