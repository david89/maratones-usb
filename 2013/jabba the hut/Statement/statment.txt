Jabba The Hut:
==============

For many years, Mos Eisly city has been the host of the mithical "Shoot Jabba
The Hut" shooting tournament (this of course, many years after Jabba the Hut
were killed by the hand of princess Leia), where big prizes are awarded to the
very best in each category. Categories range from "Apprentice" to "Grand Master".
Everyone pays sepcial attention to the "Grand Master" category, for it invites
the best shooters in the entire Galaxy.

This edition of "Shoot Jabba The Hut" has two very important competitors: Jaina
Solo and Cade Skywalker, both descendants of captain Han Solo and Luke Skywalker
respectively. Bot competitors hold an intense rivalry, not only to prove who the
best Jedi is, but to impose a superior linage.

The rules of the competition are as follows:

   1. Each player has a single round, each consisting of several subrounds.
   2. Each subround consists of N targets, each with value V_i.
   3. The score fo each target is the targets value, multiplied by the target
      multiplier.
   4. At first, the multiplier is 1 and for each target hit, it increases by 1.
   5. If a target is missed, the multiplier goes back to 1.

However, the Hutts still rule the planet and organized crime is under their
control. One of the many busineses they manage is gambling and it could not
be the case that this tournament were free of bets.

Watto, the old junk salesman is a fan of gambling and has contacts with the
competition organizers. They have told him the arangement of targets that will
be presented to each competitor and for how long. Besides, Watto know quite
precisely the amount of targets that Jaina and Cade can hit each second.
Needless to say, two Jedi master such as them never miss a shot. Watto is in
great debt with the Hutts and will lose his beloved wings to them if he does not
make a smart bet. So, he wants to know the greatest score that Jaina and Cade
can achieve in order to make his decision.

Input:
------

The first line of input will be a positive integer Q (Q <= 100), the number of
test cases.

Each test case will begin with a line with four integers N, M, J, C (1 <= N,
M <= 100; 1 <= J, C, <= 20), where N is the amount of subrounds that Jaina will
play, M the amount of subrounds Cade will play, J and C are the amount of
targets that Jaina and Cade can hit per second, respectively.

The following N+M lines will contains the information for Jaina's and Cade's
subrounds. Each subround begins with two integers D and T (1 <= D <= 2000;
1 <= T <= 20), where D is the amount of targets present in the subround and T
is the time the subround lasts. Following are D integers, with the value of
each target in that subround.

Output:
-------

For each test case, output a line with the competitor that Watto whould bet on.
In case of a tie, you should output "Watto, run!" (without quotes).
