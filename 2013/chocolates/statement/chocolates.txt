>Name: Chocolates

>Title: Chocolates

>Statement:
Mr. Yover Galarga is the owner of one of the biggest chocolate factories in the
world. One day he was thinking about life and stuff and came up with the
following problem and he is asking for your help.

His factory sells chocolate boxes of size 1 x N. Also, he has M different types
of chocolate and infinite amounts of each type. The size of the ith type of
chocolate is 1 x Li. Now, Mr. Yover is wondering in how many ways he can fill
the box of chocolates. One way is different than the other if the number of
chocolates used in the process, is different; the number of chocolates of some
type is different or if the position of the chocolates are different. For more
information, please go to the test cases explanation.

>Input format:
You have to solve T test cases, where each test case consists of the following:
the first line contains 2 number, N (the size of the chocolate box) and M (the
number of different types of chocolate). After that, one line follows with M
space-separated integers L1 L2 ... LM (the sizes of the types of chocolates).

* The maximum size of the chocolate box (N) is 10 ** 9.
* They have 0 < M <= 20 different types of chocolates.
* The size of each type of chocolate is 0 < Li <= 20.

>Output format:
Output one single line with the number of the current test case (starting at 1)
and the ways to fill the box of chocolates with the M types of chocolates (see
sample output). The answer may be very big, so we are interested in the result
modulo 10 ** 9 + 7.
