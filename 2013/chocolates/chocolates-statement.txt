Mr. Yover Galarga is the owner of two chocolate factories (two of the biggest
chocolate factories in the world). One day he was thinking about life and stuff
and came up with the following problem and he is asking for your help.

Each factory sells chocolate boxes of size 1 x N. Also, you have M different
types of chocolate and infinite amounts of each type. The size of the ith type
of chocolate is 1 x Li. Now, Mr. Yover is wondering in how many ways you can
fill the box of chocolate. One way is different than the other if the number of
chocolates used in the process, is different; the number of chocolates of some
type is different or if the position of the chocolates are different. For more
information, please go to the test cases explanation.

Each factory has certain restrictions you should know:
* First factory restrictions:
 - The maximum size of the chocolate box is 10 ** 9.
 - They have 0 < M <= 20 different types of chocolates.
 - The size of each type of chocolate is 0 < Li <= 20.
* Second factory restrictions:
 - The maximum size of the chocolate box is 10 ** 3.
 - They have 0 < M <= 10 ** 3 different types of chocolates.
 - The size of each type of chocolate is 0 < Li <= 10 ** 3.

Input format:
You have to solve T test cases, where each test case consists of the following:
the first line contains 2 number, N (the size of the chocolate box) and M (the
number of different types of chocolate). After that, one line follows with M
space-separated integers L1 L2 ... LM (the sizes of the types of chocolates).

Output format:
Output one single line with the number of ways to fill the box of chocolates
with the M types of chocolates at your disposal. The answer may be very big,
so we are interested in the result modulo 10 ** 9 + 7.
