>Statement:
Shortest problem statement ever:
You have a sequence V of size N and Q queries. Each query has a sequence W. For
each query you have to say if W is a contiguous subsequence of V.

>Input format:
You have T test cases. The first part of the input is the sequence V. The first
line contains an integer N, and the next line contains N space-separated
integers (Vi). The next line contains an integer Q, which is the number of
queries for this test case. Q lines follow: each query has two lines of input,
the first one corresponds to some integer S (the size of W), and the next line
has S space separated integers (Wi).

* 0 < T <= 5
* 0 < N <= 10 ^ 5
* 0 < Vi <= 10 ^ 4
* 0 < Q <= 10 ^ 3
* 0 < S <= 10 ^ 3
* 0 < Wi <= 10 ^ 4

>Output format:
Output one single line with the number of the current test case (starting at 1)
and then for each query of the test case, print a single line "YES" (without
quotes) if the sequence of that query is a subsequence of V, otherwise print
"NO" (without quotes.)

>Sample input:
2
4
1 5 4 2
3
3
1 5 4
2
1 4
3
2 4 5
7
1 2 3 4 5 7 6
1
7
1 2 3 4 5 7 6

>Sample output:
Case #1:
YES
NO
NO
Case #2:
YES

Explanation of the first test case:
1 5 4 are the first three elements of the sequence.
1 4 is not a (contiguous) subsquence of V.
2 4 5 is not a contiguos subsequence of V (from left to right.)
